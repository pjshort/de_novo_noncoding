# de_novo_noncoding
Description of R and Python code and other pipelines to test enrichment of de novo mutations in the DDD non-coding regions.

# Includes
- Filtering de novos based on pp_dnm score and coverage.
- Overlapping de novos/elements with roadmap epigenome project annotations.
- Overlapping de novos/elements with constraint scores.
- Matching de novos/elements with target gene prediction using Genomicus and by proximity.
